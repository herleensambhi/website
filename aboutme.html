								<h2>Why I Code?</h2>
								<p>
									I code because it empowers me to transform abstract ideas into practical solutions. During my undergraduate years, a logic course delving into logical notation and abstract mathematics sparked my interest in the fundamentals of coding. It became clear that coding held the key to creating tools that could enhance various aspects of my life, whether it be developing a reminder system for studying or crafting a calculator for my friends. I find immense joy in using code as a medium to build innovative solutions to problems and make a positive impact.</p>
								</p>
								<h2>My Background</h2>
								<p>Originally aspiring to be a lawyer, my path took a significant turn during the COVID-19 pandemic. As I witnessed the profound changes in my life and priorities, I realized that the lifestyle of a lawyer no longer aligned with my aspirations.</p>
								<p>My diverse background in Philosophy and Law has sharpened my critical thinking abilities, enhanced my articulation skills, and nurtured a logical mindset. However, it was during my fourth year that I embarked on a self-taught journey in full-stack coding through an online bootcamp called 100DEVS. Through this immersive experience, I successfully developed multiple projects, gaining expertise in both front-end and back-end development. Drawing upon my previous customer service roles, I effectively communicated with clients, ensuring their needs were met and fostering strong professional relationships.</p>
